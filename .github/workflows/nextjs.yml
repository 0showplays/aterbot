# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Next.js site to GitHub Pages
#
# To get started with Next.js see: https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started
#
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages


# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write


# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "deploy-pages"
  cancel-in-progress: true


# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on "push" or "pull request".
on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["gh-pages"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
